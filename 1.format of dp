how dp works 
general formulation 
def function(state1, state2, ...., staten)
 {
     if(base_case)return ///return or exit recursive calling when it turns to base case
     if(computed already)return table (calculated value) /// overlapping or subprograms which is already computed
     return table=calculated ///calculate which is not calculated already and save them in table
        
 }
